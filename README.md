This is an HTML file that creates a webpage about the human body's organ systems. The webpage has a navigation menu with links to different sections, each covering a specific organ system or topic.

Here's a breakdown of the HTML structure:

The header section contains:
A dropdown menu listing group members.
A home button that links to the top of the page.
A title "Human Body" in a large font size.
A navigation menu with links to different sections (Skeletal, Respiratory, Muscular, etc.).
The main content is divided into sections, each with:
A heading (h1) with the topic name.
An image related to the topic.
A horizontal rule (hr) to separate sections.
The sections are:
Home: An introduction to the human body organ systems.
Skeletal: Covers the vertebral column, joints, and bones.
Respiratory: Covers the lungs, nose, trachea, and diaphragm.
Muscular: Covers skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles.
Circulatory: Covers the heart, arteries, veins, and blood.
Digestive: Covers the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus.
Nervous: Covers the spinal cord, medulla, pons, cerebellum, midbrain, diencephalon, and cerebral hemispheres.
